# getbased-relay

Self-hosted [Evolu](https://github.com/evoluhq/evolu) CRDT relay for getbased sync, with structured logging, metrics, quota management, owner self-service endpoints, and the optional Agent Access context gateway.

Wraps [`@evolu/nodejs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@evolu/nodejs) — all sync protocol and CRDT logic is from Evolu. This project adds the operational layer for running a relay in production.

Built for [getbased](https://github.com/elkimek/get-based), a blood work dashboard that uses Evolu for cross-device sync.

## Evolu compatibility

Evolu is an npm dependency here, not vendored source. The current checkout targets `@evolu/common` 8.14.0 and `@evolu/nodejs` 4.1.0, matching the core packages in upstream relay 4.1.3. The ranges in `package.json` permit compatible updates within those majors; `package-lock.json` pins the exact versions used by `npm ci` and the Docker build.

| Relay | `@evolu/common` | `@evolu/nodejs` | Node.js |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| v2.0.1 | `^8.14.0` (locked to 8.14.0) | `^4.1.0` (locked to 4.1.0) | >= 24.20.0 |
| v2.0.0 | `^8.9.0` (locked to 8.9.0) | `^3.2.0` (locked to 3.2.0) | >= 24.20.0 |
| v1.2.3 | `^7.4.0` | `^2.4.0` | >= 22.0.0 |

The package version streams are independent: Evolu 8 uses the 8.x `common` package; the current Node adapter is 4.x. This relay upgrade preserves the existing WebSocket protocol, owner keys, relay tables, self-service response fields, and Agent Access proof format. It does not require an application or browser Evolu upgrade.

The mirrored WebSocket adapter retains GetBased's storage decorator and incorporates upstream's 30-second heartbeats, 16 MiB unsent broadcast limit, and shutdown guards. Explicit optional tooling overrides avoid the Node adapter's conflicting lint peer resolutions; SQLite install scripts are allowed for npm versions that require an allowlist.

## Why

Upstream now provides configurable per-owner quotas and leveled console output. This wrapper adds global payload admission checks, JSON operational events, database readiness and metrics, replay-protected compaction, signed owner self-service endpoints, and the optional Agent Access gateway without forking the Evolu monorepo.

See [evoluhq/evolu#661](https://github.com/evoluhq/evolu/issues/661) for the full writeup.

## Quick start

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elkimek/getbased-relay.git
cd getbased-relay
docker build -t getbased-relay:latest .
docker run -d \
  --name relay \
  -p 127.0.0.1:4000:4000 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:4003:4003 \
  -v relay-data:/data \
  -e SELF_BIND=0.0.0.0 \
  -e QUOTA_PER_OWNER_MB=10 \
  -e ADMIN_TOKEN=your-secret \
  getbased-relay:latest
```

Or run the relay and Context Gateway together with Docker Compose. Copy `.env.example`, replace the blank `CONTEXT_VERIFIER_TOKEN` with the output of `openssl rand -hex 32`, then start the stack:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Node.js

Requires Node.js >= 24.20.0. TypeScript is installed as a development dependency.

Both Docker images pin Node.js 24.21.0 LTS by tag and digest. Dependabot keeps updates within the current Node major; a future runtime major requires a separate LTS and compatibility review. CI runs the regression suite inside the built relay image and checks the built gateway image's startup, verified context upload, persistence, read, and revocation.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm start
```

## Configuration

All settings via environment variables. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `RELAY_PORT` | `4000` | Evolu WebSocket relay port |
| `ADMIN_PORT` | `4001` | Health/metrics HTTP port (the supplied Compose stack overrides this to internal port `4002`) |
| `SELF_PORT` | `4003` | Owner-scoped self-service HTTP port |
| `SELF_BIND` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address for self-service port (set to `0.0.0.0` to expose directly without a reverse proxy) |
| `SELF_ENABLED` | `true` | Set `false` to disable `/self/*` endpoints |
| `CONTEXT_VERIFIER_PORT` | `4004` | Private Agent Access proof-verification port |
| `CONTEXT_VERIFIER_BIND` | `127.0.0.1` | Verifier TCP bind address when a Unix socket is not configured |
| `CONTEXT_VERIFIER_SOCKET` | *(none)* | Unix socket path; takes precedence over TCP and is used by the supplied compose deployment |

## Endpoints

**Relay port** (default 4000) — Evolu WebSocket sync. Connect your Evolu client with:

```javascript
transports: [{ type: "WebSocket", url: "wss://your-relay.example.com" }]
```

**Admin port** (default 4001, localhost only) — HTTP endpoints:

- `GET /health` — Always public. Returns `{"status":"ok","uptime":...,"version":...}` when the relay Run is active and its database has the required tables; returns `503` with `status: "unhealthy"` otherwise. It is a readiness check, not an end-to-end sync probe.
- `GET /metrics` — Requires the admin bearer token when `ADMIN_TOKEN` is configured. Returns owner count, per-owner storage, DB size, connection count, and quota settings.
- `POST /compact-owner?ownerId=<base64url-22-char>` — Requires the admin bearer token. Replaces every relay message with a small exact-timestamp replay tombstone and clears the owner's live usage. A stale or offline paired client can reconnect safely: replayed history is acknowledged but not stored, while timestamps the relay has never compacted remain valid new writes. Response body: `{ownerId, deletedMessages, protectedTimestamps, beforeStoredBytes, afterStoredBytes}`.

**Self-service port** (default 4003) — owner-scoped HTTP endpoints, signed with the client's own writeKey. No admin token; one user can never act on another user's owner. Intended to be exposed via the same reverse proxy as the relay port.

- `POST /self/compact-owner` — Body: `{ownerId, timestamp, signature}`. Same replay-protected compaction as `/compact-owner`, but client-driven. Sync each device's latest changes first so the chosen canonical device has current application data; offline devices no longer need to discard their local Evolu history before reconnecting.
- `GET /self/owner-storage?ownerId=...&timestamp=...&signature=...` — Returns `{ownerId, storedBytes, quotaBytes, messageCount, lastWriteToken}` from the live relay database. Besides an accurate quota readout, `messageCount` and `lastWriteToken` let a client confirm that a push was actually persisted.

**Auth scheme.** `signature = HMAC-SHA256(writeKey, "{context}:{ownerId}:{timestamp}").hex()` where `context` is `"compact"` or `"storage"`. The relay looks up the writeKey in its `evolu_writeKey` table (the same secret the Evolu client already holds for pushes), recomputes the HMAC, and timing-safe-compares. The timestamp must be within ±5 minutes of server time. All auth failures return a uniform `401 unauthorized` to avoid an owner-existence oracle.

**Rate limit.** Per-IP token bucket caps `/self/compact-owner` at 10 requests/minute and `/self/owner-storage` at 60 requests/minute. Excess returns `429` with a `Retry-After` header. When the relay is behind a reverse proxy on the same host (peer = loopback), the limiter trusts the leftmost `X-Forwarded-For` entry; otherwise it uses the socket peer. Caddy's `reverse_proxy` directive sets `X-Forwarded-For` automatically, so no extra config is needed.

**Log coalescing.** Repeated unauthorized requests with the same `(ownerId, IP, reason)` are logged once on first occurrence; further hits within 60 s suppress, and a `self.coalesced_unauthorized` summary fires on window expiry if the count exceeded 1. Stops a flood from filling the log without losing the first signal of any abuse pattern.

## Reverse proxy

The relay port serves WebSocket only. Use Caddy or nginx for TLS termination:

```
# Caddyfile — option A: dedicated subdomain per surface
sync.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:4000
}

self.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:4003
}
```

```
# Caddyfile — option B: single hostname, path-routing (what sync.getbased.health uses)
sync.example.com {
    handle /self/* {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:4003
    }
    handle {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:4000
    }
}
```

Both patterns work; the client (`get-based`) derives `https://<relay-hostname>/self/...` from the WebSocket URL by default. For self-hosters who want to skip the reverse proxy entirely (expose port 4003 directly to the internet), set `SELF_BIND=0.0.0.0` and have clients hard-code their own URL via the `labcharts-self-url` localStorage override.

The admin port always binds to process-local `127.0.0.1`. A native Node.js deployment can reach it through an SSH tunnel; in the supplied Compose stack it stays container-only on port 4002 and can be queried with `docker compose exec relay`. The self-service port defaults to `127.0.0.1` too; container deployments explicitly bind it to `0.0.0.0` inside the container while publishing only to host loopback for the reverse proxy. Every `/self/*` endpoint is HMAC-authenticated against per-owner write keys.

## Context Gateway

HTTP API for Agent Access. MCP servers and bot plugins use it to fetch encrypted, browser-rendered getbased context for an external AI assistant. Runs alongside the Evolu relay as a separate service.

### How it works

Agent Access storage is owner-bound, not token-bound:

- the browser encrypts context locally before upload;
- the bearer token is only a read capability;
- every write is HMAC-signed with the Evolu owner's `writeKey`;
- the gateway sends the proof to a private relay verifier that returns only yes/no; the gateway never mounts the relay database and never receives a write key;
- token hashes map to owner IDs in `agent-token-map.json`;
- per-owner limits cap profiles, active tokens, per-profile payload size, and total Agent Access storage.

This prevents users from bypassing relay quota by generating unlimited random Agent Access tokens. Legacy token-hash files remain readable during rollout, but new writes require owner proof.

The verifier listens on a shared Unix socket and requires a
separate `CONTEXT_VERIFIER_TOKEN`. Generate that deployment token with
`openssl rand -hex 32`; it is an internal caller credential, not an Evolu
owner key. The public Agent Access protocol and browser HMAC format are
unchanged.

The supplied Context Gateway limiter keys on a dedicated
`X-Getbased-Client-IP` header rather than `X-Forwarded-For`. The reverse proxy
must overwrite it from the actual socket peer:

```caddyfile
handle /api/* {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:4001 {
        header_up X-Getbased-Client-IP {http.request.remote.host}
    }
}
```

### Endpoints

All endpoints require an Agent Access bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/context` | — | Push encrypted context. Body: `{ ownerId, timestamp, signature, context, profileId }`. Signature is `HMAC-SHA256(writeKey, "agent-context:{ownerId}:{timestamp}:{sha256(token)}:{profileId}:{sha256(context)}")`. |
| `GET /api/context` | — | Get the default profile's encrypted context for this token's owner mapping |
| `GET /api/context?profile=<id>` | — | Get a specific profile's encrypted context |
| `DELETE /api/context` | — | Revoke this token's owner mapping, signed with the same owner proof over an empty context |

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` runs both services and keeps private surfaces off the public interface:

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Evolu relay | host `127.0.0.1:4000` | CRDT sync (WebSocket), intended for reverse proxying |
| Context gateway | host `127.0.0.1:4001` | Agent Access context API, intended for reverse proxying |
| Relay self-service | host `127.0.0.1:4003` | Owner-scoped storage and compaction API |
| Relay admin | container-only `:4002` | Health, metrics, and operator compaction |
| Private verifier | Unix socket | Internal yes/no owner-proof verification; no listening TCP port |

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Releases

For the v2.0.1 upgrade, back up the relay volume before rebuilding. Preserve the current environment variables and proxy routes; no database migration, owner-key rotation, or browser package update is needed. Global quota admission now checks the projected payload total on every write and rejects writes when usage cannot be read. Run one relay process per database; the in-process compaction locks and admission checks do not coordinate multiple relay processes.

`npm test` builds and runs storage, WebSocket, HTTP, quota, and process-lifecycle regression tests. CI runs the same suite. The application can be validated separately against the upgraded relay before deployment; the upstream browser package update remains a separate change.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the versioned history and upgrade notes. GitHub release pages should be cut from the matching version commit; the package version, changelog entry, and tag must agree.
